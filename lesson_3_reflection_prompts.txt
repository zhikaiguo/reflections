-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Use remote repository when you want to collaborate with other people and share you projects publicly online. 
Keep your file locally if you just need to track changes to your self.

-Why might you want to always pull changes rather than having Git automactically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.

There are times when you and other people are working on different things. You don't want your version to mix with the other people's version before discussing about it.
